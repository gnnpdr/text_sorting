It's kind of pathetic
You get all erratic
About dirty dishes
Congesting the sink.
I'm tired of your bothers
Remember our fathers
They dwelled in a world
Filled with rubbish and stink.
But when all hopes was lost
Someone raised from the dust
He was handsome and cunning
His haircut had style.
Courage was shining in his eyes
As he said ... you guys
Mind your own business
I'm off now goodbye.
Huzzah he's off now goodbye!
